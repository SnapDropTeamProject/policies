Commits are the steps taken while developing a code in your branch. It is always better to keep the steps as small as possible and commit changes as often as it can be done. The advantage of keeping commits short is that they simplify the job for the reviewers later on in the **Pull Request**.

Each commit messages shoud start with a tag representing the change:

- **feat:** - if the change is related to the feature development.
- **update:** - if the change is related to the update development.
- **fix:** - if the change is related to the fix development.

Each commit message **must** clearly express what changes were made starting from the moment of last commit.

Here is an example of the commit message:

`feat: added input validation for the CreateUserHandler.`
